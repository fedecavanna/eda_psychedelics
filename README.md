# Exploratory data analysis (Psychedelics effect comparison)
 
## Note
This notebook is still under development. Some of the block comments may be not explanatory or in spanish.

## About
This GitHub repository contains the code and data for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the cognitive effects of oral consumption of two distinct psychedelic drugs, DMT and psilocybin. The data used in this analysis is sourced from two papers that still are being written, as well as a published one. You can find the references in the Bibliography section.

The goal of this analysis is to explore and visualize the cognitive effects of these two psychedelic substances. This file provides an overview of the data preprocessing, data wrangling, descriptive statistics, and simple visualizations conducted in this project.

## Features
The project's main features include:
- Data preprocessing and wrangling for both psilocybin and DMT datasets.
- Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis.
- Statistical hypothesis testing to compare the effects of psilocybin and DMT.
- Visualization of significant differences between the two drugs.
- Correlation matrix analysis for scales.

## Conclusions
The exploratory data analysis revealed significant insights into the cognitive effects of psilocybin and DMT. Some of the notable findings include:
- Effects on perception, emotion, and cognition.
- Differences in cognitive experiences between the two drugs.
- Correlation patterns among various scales measuring different cognitive aspects.
